# Reflexive Pronouns

Reflexive pronouns are used when the subject and the object of a verb refer to the same person or thing. While reflexive constructions are very common in many other languages, they are less frequent in English. When needed, the verb is followed by one of the following reflexive pronouns:

| Reflexive Pronoun | Example                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| myself            | I saw it for myself.                |
| yourself          | Don‚Äôt burn yourself!                |
| himself           | He hurt himself.                    |
| herself           | She did it herself.                 |
| itself            | The cat scratched itself.           |
| ourselves         | We made it ourselves.               |
| yourselves        | Did you paint the house yourselves? |
| themselves        | They were speaking to themselves.   |

## Grammatical Rules

### 1. Reflexive pronouns with transitive verbs

Reflexive pronouns can be used with many transitive verbs, especially when the subject does something to themselves.

**Examples:**

- How did he hurt **himself**?
- We really enjoyed **ourselves** on holiday.
- I blame **myself** for the mistake.

### 2. Reflexive pronouns for emphasis

Sometimes reflexive pronouns are used to emphasize the subject. In this case, they often appear at the end of the sentence.

**Examples:**

- We painted the house **ourselves**.
- What a great party! Did you prepare everything **yourself**?

### 3. "By" + reflexive pronoun to mean "alone"

Using **by** before a reflexive pronoun indicates that someone is alone or did something without help.

**Examples:**

- I often prefer to be **by myself**.
- She learned to read **all by herself**.

### 4. Some verbs change meaning with reflexive pronouns

Certain verbs take on a new meaning when used reflexively.

**Examples:**

- Help **yourself** to some coffee. _(meaning: take freely)_
- We found **ourselves** in the middle of a complicated situation. _(meaning: discovered unexpectedly)_

### 5. No reflexive needed for routine actions

Reflexive pronouns are **not** used for actions people normally do to themselves ‚Äî unless the action needs to be emphasized.

**Examples:**

- ‚úÖ I have to shave every other day.
- üö´ I have to shave **myself** every other day. _(unnecessary)_

### 6. Common expressions with reflexive pronouns

Some fixed expressions use reflexive pronouns with specific meanings.

**Examples:**

- Behave **yourselves**! _(behave well)_
- Help **yourself**. _(offering food/drink)_
- Make **yourself** at home. _(feel comfortable)_

## Reciprocal Pronouns

A reciprocal pronoun is used when two or more people do the same thing to each other. It is **not** a reflexive form.

The most common reciprocal expression is:

- **each other**

**Example:**

- John and Peter speak to **each other** every day.
