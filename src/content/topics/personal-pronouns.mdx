# Personal Pronouns

Within personal pronouns, the English language distinguishes between pronouns that function as the subject (subject pronouns) and those that function as the object (object pronouns).

| Pronouns (as subject) | Example        |
| --------------------- | -------------- |
| I                     | I am here.     |
| You                   | You are here.  |
| He                    | He is here.    |
| She                   | She is here.   |
| It                    | It is here.    |
| We                    | We are here.   |
| They                  | They are here. |

| Pronouns (as object) | Example           |
| -------------------- | ----------------- |
| Me                   | Can you help me?  |
| You                  | I can help you.   |
| Him                  | Can you see him?  |
| Her                  | Give it to her.   |
| It                   | Give it a kick.   |
| Us                   | Can you see us?   |
| Them                 | He can help them. |

In English, there is no formal or informal distinction for the second-person pronoun. Native speakers do not differentiate between levels of formality when addressing others — the word "you" is used in all contexts, regardless of formality, gender, or number.

The only distinction appears in the **reflexive form**, where English uses **"yourself"** for the singular and **"yourselves"** for the plural.

## Neuter Form

English pronouns distinguish between masculine (he), feminine (she), and neuter (it).

The personal pronoun **"it"** is used when referring to things, animals whose sex is unknown, or abstract concepts such as time, weather, or distance. While **"it"** is singular, **"they"** is used as a general plural form for people, animals, or things.

### Examples

- Where is **it** (the book)?
- What time is **it**?
- **It** is raining.

  “It” is a very important particle in English that Spanish speakers often
  forget to use.

## Function

### 1. The pronoun as subject

The subject of a sentence is the person or thing that performs the action of the verb. Subject pronouns are used when the pronoun is the doer of the action. Unlike in Spanish, subject pronouns in English must **always** be present.

| Example        | Subject |
| -------------- | ------- |
| I am ill       | I       |
| You are tall   | You     |
| He is handsome | He      |
| We are tired   | We      |

### 2. The pronoun as object

Object pronouns appear after the verb or after prepositions such as “for”, “to”, “with”, or “at.”

| Example                           | Object | Subject |
| --------------------------------- | ------ | ------- |
| I can help you.                   | you    | I       |
| Can you see him?                  | him    | you     |
| He is going to the party with us. | us     | He      |
| It (the letter) is for you.       | you    | It      |
