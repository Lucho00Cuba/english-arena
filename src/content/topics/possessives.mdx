# Possessives

Possessives are classified into two types according to their function in the sentence: **possessive adjectives** and **possessive pronouns**.

## Possessive Adjectives

These function as determiners and appear **before a noun** to show ownership.

| Possessive Adjective | Example                                |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| my                   | This is my house.                      |
| your                 | This is your house.                    |
| his                  | This is his bicycle.                   |
| her                  | This is her dress.                     |
| its                  | The dog doesn’t like to be on its own. |
| our                  | These are our suitcases.               |
| your                 | These are your seats.                  |
| their                | These are their books.                 |

## Possessive Pronouns

These replace the noun and stand **alone**, usually at the end of a sentence.

| Possessive Pronoun | Example                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| mine               | This book is mine.      |
| yours              | Is this book yours?     |
| his                | This bicycle is his.    |
| hers               | The dress is hers.      |
| ours               | The suitcases are ours. |
| yours              | These seats are yours.  |
| theirs             | This pencil is theirs.  |

  Note: The possessive pronoun "its" is almost never used in modern English.
  Sentences like *"The house is its"* are typically avoided or rephrased.

## Function

### 1. As a Determiner (before a noun)

Grammatically, the possessive adjective acts as a determiner of the noun it accompanies, and it always comes before the object.

**Examples:**

- **My** car is blue.
- **His** house is big.
- **Their** idea is excellent.

### 2. As a Pronoun (replacing a noun)

Grammatically, the possessive pronoun replaces the noun, and it typically appears at the end of the sentence.

**Examples:**

- The blue car is **mine**.
- The big house is **his**.
- The idea was **theirs**.

# Possessive Pronouns vs. the Genitive Case

The genitive case (using **'s**) should not be confused with possessive pronouns.

We can say:

- **Her** dress...  
  or
- **Andrea's** dress...

In both cases, we indicate who owns the dress. In the first sentence, the possessive adjective “her” refers to a previously known person. In the second, the name of the possessor is explicitly given.

## Grammatical Rules

1. **Use the genitive to refer to people.**

**Examples:**

- **Paul's** house...
- **Mary's** bike...

2. **Use “of” to refer to things or places.**

**Examples:**

- The wheel **of** the bike...
- Washington is the capital **of** the United States.

3. **Use the genitive at the end of a sentence to avoid repetition.**

This is often used in response to a previous question. The noun is omitted because it's understood from context.

**Examples (Questions/Answers):**

- Q: Where is **your** sister?  
  A: She is at my **parents'**.

- Q: Whose house is this?  
  A: It is **Michael's**.

4. **When there is more than one possessor, the apostrophe comes after the “s”.**

**Examples:**

- The **girls'** toys...
- The **students'** exams...

<BlockQuote type="warn">
  When the name of the possessor ends in "s", some style guides recommend adding
  only an apostrophe (e.g., **Luis' house**), while others accept **Luis's
  house**. Choose one style and apply it consistently.
