# Demonstrative Pronouns

Demonstrative pronouns show whether something is **singular or plural**, and whether it is **near or far** from the speaker.

The four main demonstrative pronouns in English are:

- **this** (singular, near)
- **that** (singular, far)
- **these** (plural, near)
- **those** (plural, far)

## Distance

| Distance | Singular | Plural |
| -------- | -------- | ------ |
| Near     | this     | these  |
| Far      | that     | those  |

### Examples

- I like **this** car. _(near, singular)_
- I like **these** cars. _(near, plural)_
- I like **that** car. _(far, singular)_
- I like **those** cars. _(far, plural)_

<BlockQuote type="info">
  When a demonstrative word appears **with a noun** (e.g., *this car*), it
  functions as a **demonstrative adjective**. When it stands **alone** (e.g.,
  *this is great*), it is a **demonstrative pronoun**.

## Demonstrative Pronouns Without a Noun

Demonstrative pronouns can also stand alone, without a noun. These are common in spoken and informal English.

### Examples

- **This** is a good book.
- What is **that**?
- **These** are delicious.
- I don’t like **those**.

## Everyday Uses of Demonstrative Pronouns

Demonstrative pronouns are frequently used in everyday situations, especially in spoken English.

1. **Answering or making phone calls**

   - Hello. **This** is Alicia.

2. **When you’re unsure who you are speaking with**

   - Peter, is **that** you?

3. **Introducing someone**

   - Lucy, **this** is my friend Jill.

4. **Referring to something in the past**

   - **That** pizza was delicious.

  “That pizza” could refer to one we just finished eating, or even one we had a
  year ago on vacation. Context tells us how far in time the speaker is
  reaching.
